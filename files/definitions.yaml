        The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an object stays
        cached in the edge server before additional requests are forwarded

      description:
        Sets the extent to which content is cached on CloudFronts edge
        servers.  By limiting to edge servers in cheaper locations
        throughout the world, you can lower your expenses at the cost of
        less coverage.  When this value is omitted, sky-media defaults to 100,
        which is cheapest, but comes with the smallest coverage area.
