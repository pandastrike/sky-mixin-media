        The name of the S3 bucket to be created.  Needs to be globally unique, among all AWS accounts.

    hostname:
      description:
        The hostname for your CDN.  This hostname is attached to the environment's domain to form a URL in both CloudFront and Route53
    expires:
      description:
        The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an object stays
        cached in the edge server before additional requests are forwarded
        to the S3 bucket to check for updates.  When this value is omitted,
        sky-media defaults to 60 seconds.

      description:
        Sets the extent to which content is cached on CloudFronts edge
        servers.  By limiting to edge servers in cheaper locations
        throughout the world, you can lower your expenses at the cost of
        less coverage.  When this value is omitted, sky-media defaults to 100,
        which is cheapest, but comes with the smallest coverage area.

optimization:
